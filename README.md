# Dictionary using Dijkstra's algorithm

University Project: Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in a dictionary (French)

______________________________________________________________________________

This C-program reads a *.txt and creates a hashtable.
This 'dictionary' is used to find the closest path
between two words by only changing one letter at a
time and checking if this 'neighboring word' exists.
